# üé• Skill Tagging from Video using AWS CodePipeline & Flask

This project enables automatic skill tagging of educational videos through a fully-deployed AWS pipeline. It combines video summarization, transcription, and LLM-based tagging, and is powered by a Flask-based web UI hosted on an EC2 instance.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This application allows users to upload videos via a web interface. The backend uses a combination of image snapshots and audio transcription to:

- Generate a summary of the video using OpenAI's GPT and Whisper models.
- Perform skill tagging by matching the content to a CSV of predefined skills.
- Display all outputs in a clean, single-page Flask UI.
- Store all uploads in an S3 bucket.

Deployment is handled by AWS CodePipeline, which:

- Uses this GitHub repository as the source.
- Triggers CodeDeploy to set up and run the Flask app on EC2.
- Automatically redeploys the server on every GitHub commit.

## üß† Key Features

- **Flask Web Interface** ‚Äì Upload videos, enter a prompt, and view results directly in the browser.
- **S3 Integration** ‚Äì Uploaded media and generated thumbnails are stored and retrieved via S3.
- **Video-to-Text Processing** ‚Äì Extracts audio using `moviepy` and transcribes using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Image-Based Summarization** ‚Äì Captures key video frames for visual summarization using GPT-4o.
- **LLM-based Skill Tagging** ‚Äì Tags videos with relevant skills using a curated CSV file and GPT model.
- **CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline** ‚Äì Fully automated deployments with GitHub + EC2 + CodeDeploy.

| File / Dir         | Purpose                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app.py`           | Core Flask application: handles uploads, summarization, transcription, tagging |
| `appspec.yml`      | CodeDeploy specification for deployment hooks                  |
| `buildspec.yml`    | CodePipeline build script (archives app for deployment)        |
| `constants.py`     | Contains the default prompt used in summarization              |
| `index.html`       | HTML template (inline in `app.py`) for the web UI              |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies                                             |
| `testing.sh`       | Shell script for basic testing / local setup                   |
| `scripts/`         | Deployment lifecycle scripts (install, start, stop)            |

## üîß Deployment Pipeline

- **Source** ‚Äì GitHub repository  
- **Build** ‚Äì Compresses the repo into `app.zip`  
- **Deploy** ‚Äì CodeDeploy:
  - Installs dependencies  
  - Starts the Flask server via `gunicorn`  
  - Stops/restarts on new deployments  

**EC2 Setup Notes:**

- Flask runs on port `8000`  
- Server is served using `gunicorn`  
- Deployment hooks defined in `scripts/start_server.sh`, etc.
